subtitle: Designing a predictive and preventive financial crimes AI Application.
description: While working at Teradata I was a part of R&D devision we called "Art of the Possible". At its core was the basis of Skunkwork projects that often didn't go anywhere. That said, they sometimes they morphed into separate initiatives or drove other ideas. Apologies for spoilers, this project was not much different but reshaped my career along with other business specific outcomes.
