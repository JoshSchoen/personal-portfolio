While working as the Lead UX Designer at Allen Edmonds. I learned a ton about e-commerce and B2C user experience. To this day what I learned about data driven design has shaped how I go about designing and developing experiences and interfaces.

There are many types of conversions in e-commerce, page views, add to cart, shopping cart views and the ultimate and the end of the conversion funnel, pacing an order. As a part of the e-commerce team at Allen Edmonds we were always trying to find ways to increase our checkout conversion rate.

#### The goal:

- Increase checkout conversion rate: Online sales contributed to about 35% of total revenue. Being Allen Edmonds didn't have a major presence at big box retail stores it was always important to try and increase online sales.

### The Challenge

<SectionImage margin="4" imgSrc="/challenge.png" alt="Challenge" />

<SectionContent margin="4">

Find opportunities to reduce customer friction and cart abandonment during the checkout process. Increase conversion rate by 2.5 - 3%. While this percent doesn't seem like much in the market of high-end mens shoes this is actually a pretty lofty goal when purchasing shoes someone hasn't tried on before that start around $300 USD.

### The Solution

<SectionContent margin="4">

The e-commerce team was small but nimble. We had a business analyst, web producer, the director of e-commerce and myself, the Lead UX Designer. Together we looked at every step of the checkout process including:

- Adding to cart
- Shopping cart review
- Shipping
- Billing
- Pacing an order

Through our research using Google Analytics we noticed that cart abandonment increased when users landed on the billing page but we didn't understand why.

While we had page view analytics we didn't have data about what users were actually doing on the page. Generally speaking billing pages tend to be form heavy, if the user wasn't logged into their Allen Edmonds account, the billing forms would not auto populate.  Our hypothesis was users were getting "hung up" on one of the form elements but we didn't have usage tracking to validate that hypothesis.

I was in charge of tagging all pages using a tag manager that integrated with Google Analytics. We tagged all form elements on the billing page and allowed the data to be collected for about 2 months. We found that a required email field at the top of the page, before the actual billing form was not being interacted with from time to time and was a required field. If the user was not logged into their account the email field was not getting populated. After a unauthenticated user filled out the billing form the user would try and submit the form but the form would not allow the user to proceed to the place order page. Interestingly there was error messaging but it was close to the email field and user was not able to see it because it was out of view. Instead the user got frustrated and abandoned their cart, thus loosing important revenue which caused lower conversion rates.  Because we had tracking on the "proceed to place order" call to action we able to further diagnose where the issues was coming from.


We went through many design concepts and ultimately decided to do a A/B test to ensure the data was pointing to the correct issue. The control was the current billing form with the email. The test was moving the email input field to the previous shipping page. Our hypothesis was the email should be co-located with other personal contact information rather than above the billing form.

### The Result

<SectionContent margin="4">

The A/B test was 50/50 split test and ran for about a six weeks until the results was statistically significant (at or above 95% confidence). We also monitored the test closely to make sure the test was not dramatically reducing checkout rate. While monitoring the test we started seeing the test was performing well but without it being at or above 95% it was not enough to take action. 

We continued with the test, once the test became statistically significant there was a clear winner, moving the email field to be co-located with the shipping form was the winner. We implemented the change and over the next few months we saw the conversation rate increase by 1.65%.

While we didn't meet our total goal of increasing conversion rate by 2.5 - 3% we did significantly improve the checkout process. We then looked at other areas to improve the user experience by creating more engaging and informative content which got us a little closer which also increased our discoverability through SEO optimization.

### Takeaways

<SectionContent margin="4">

I managed many A/B tests during my time at Allen Edmonds, often they came back insignificant so we moved to other opportunities. This particular A/B test was unique in that we did a lot research, analysis,  and concepts prior to running the test. After using this approach we repeated it in other areas of the website and the results where much better because we took the time to really understand the why's before running the test. Testing in isolation is also critical part of improving user experience through A/B testing techniques. Always reduce the number of variables when testing.
