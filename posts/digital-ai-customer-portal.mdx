  Digital.ai was born out of 5 separate companies that provided tools and capabilities throughout the software delivery life-cycle. The goal was to develop a new company delivering on Value Stream Management (VSM) for large enterprise organizations going through and maintaining their digital transformation.

  To deliver on the promise of VSM, there was a need to bring the products together and the Customer Portal was big part of that solution.

### Mapping & Discovery
<SectionContent margin="4">

The Customer Portal was an evergreen effort. To ensure the user flows were valid the team went through several information architecture and user journey mapping exercises before and during the design process. Development teams were working on API services and overall architecture in parallel while collaborating and validating the UX/UI approach with the help of product management.

### The Result

<SectionContent margin="4">

While this work is still in progress the internal "Customer 0" was launched and was received very well. "Customer 0" refers to Digital.ai using our own services and products as if the entire organization was a Digital.ai customer. This helped the company understand some potential customer challenges before they become a challenge for external customers.

Development continues for internal operational tools, customer consumption and entitlement experiences.

### Takeaways

<SectionContent margin="4">

I'm particularly proud of this project as it changed the course of Digital.ai and in some ways the agile and devOps market to help enterprises with their digital transformation through Value Stream Management. While customer portals are not a novel idea creating an end-to-end platform for software delivery insights is. I believe the initial concepts and foundational services we designed and developed will enable many large enterprise companies to truly realize their digital transformation aspirations.

There were many challenges along the way, as the Director of UX for the company I was able to lead and establish best practices for not only UX but product management and engineering. At every stage of the process this brought questions that tested the vision.  Bringing many disparate companies together under one unified suite of products is full of design, development and business challenges and I feel honored to have been a part of the journey to help launch Digital.ai as a single company with a focused vision on Value Steam Management.
