subtitle: Designing a predictive and preventative financial crimes AI Application.
description:
  While working at Teradata I was a part of the R&D division we called "Art of the
  Possible". Basically it was where business ideas went to incubate to evaluate if the idea had legs to be brought on as a product or a features of an existing product. If the idea didn't ake off, the ideas, components and resources often morphed into different initiatives or drove other ideas. Apologies for spoilers, this project was not much
  different but it did reshaped my career along with other business specific outcomes.

#### The goal:

- As a proof of concept create AI/ML models and user experience for the finance industry to identify financial cyber crimes before they occur.
- Create customer engagement opportunities to further develop the proof of concept with real-word data.

### The Challenge

<SectionImage width="60%" margin="4" imgSrc="/challenge.png" alt="Challenge" />

<SectionContent margin="4">

Create a customer reference application that data scientists and financial crimes analysts can use to better understand risks for potential cyber security and customer impersonation attacks. The experience should be able to monitor model decay, effectiveness and predictors.

### The Solution

In order to create such an application we needed to get access to customer data. I'm not a Data Scientist but I do know one of the key ingredients of developing applications that leverage AI/ML techniques is lots and lots of data.  We partnered with internal Data Scientists, Data Architects and a few industry subject matter experts to better understand what an analyst might want to see in the application. Through this process we identified various data sets to start training models on. Collaboratively we worked on what type of information might be interesting to surface in the UI to helped Data Scientists and business analysts better understand value and level of effort.

We took a business intelligence dashboard approach in order to surface specific KPIs and enable users to drill down and take action on specific abnormalities in the data.

We also partnered with a startup company Graphistry to include powerful GPU driven graph visualizations to uncover patterns and connections that might indicate fraudulent activity. This particular visualization was more for exploratory type analysis but allowed for deeper human intervention beyond AI/ML capabilities.

Over time AI/ML models can decay. Data constantly changes and models need to be periodically retrained with up to date data to ensure the model is producing accurate results. The fluctuation of data is hard to predict thus, it was also important to enable analysts (sometimes called citizen data scientists) to understand not only what models were in production but how effective the in-production model was in real-time. Each model is different and often used as a set of models working together. We developed scorecard dashboard view was added to communicate this type of information.

### The Result

<SectionContent margin="4">

Once we had the reference application in working order we set out to partner with sales to generate some excitement with existing financial customers. The proof of concept was so well received it was presented at Teradata's annual sales conference as a key AI/ML analytics solution. The reference application also helped to sell in strategic data science consulting services to a couple of the largest banks in the world.

The team successfully partnered with these customers to help push fraud predicting offerings and solutions further. The reference application was huge part of demonstrating the art of the possible to further AI/ML solutions and capabilities for Teradata.

This work merged with other AI/ML initiatives around model management and governance that I redesigned and where also developed the front-end. I'm happy to say that all of this work eventually spun into a separate startup company that I was fortunate enough to work for. There I designed and built a proof of concept to MVP in less than 3 months, but that is another story for another time.

### Takeaways

<SectionContent margin="4">

There were a lot of lessons learned on this project and for other projects that spun out of it. Personally, it was a shift in where I wanted to focus my skills and career. I immediately recognized the need for product and the business side of organizations to have a better understanding of their AI/ML IP. I also felt pretty confident that data science will become next generation of predictive analytics. It was clear to me I wanted to be part of that as much as possible moving forward. Since then I've tried to attach myself to applications using or monitoring AI/ML models which drove me to get closer to DevOps and agile planning world. It is some of the most interesting and complex work I have done in my career and was fortunate enough to work alongside some of the smartest people I've ever had to privilege to work with.

As I mentioned, this particular project was a huge milestone in my career, while the reference application didn't become a long standing offering for Teradata, it opened the door to many other opportunities. Discovery, prototyping, research and development is an important part of the software delivery process. The team was small and nimble which allowed us to keep development costs down while moving very fast which is the essence of working with an agile mindset. I have worked this way many times in my career, when I'm am to combined my design and development skills while partnering with subject matter experts we move very fast and are quick to prove or disprove concepts. This has turned out to be one of my core strengths as a leader, strategist and individual contributor and it all started with a vision to operational AI to predict fraud.
