#### Turning ideas into solutions

Having opportunity to design and develop business intelligence, agile planning, DevOps, AI/ML and e-commerce experiences I work to collaborate at every step of the software delivery cycle. This allows me engage in deep technical conversations with engineering, decompose business requirements for UX, translate all of those findings to product design while tying everything back to the product vision.

#### Systems Architect

I’ve been fortunate enough to work on multiple design systems and component libraries at three different companies so I'm well versed in system thinking. One of my core strengths is connecting design and development by helping to shape holistic product vision and strategy. I’m able to break down that vision into the piece parts required to incrementally deliver UX/UI components and business value to produce cohesive and streamlined experiences. I love to solve complex problems and collaborate with cross functional teams to deliver intuitive experiences. You'll often hear me say, less UI is better UX.

#### Developer and user experience

Bridging the gap of and DX (Developer Experience) and traditional UX (User Experience) is very interesting to me. I passionate about building compelling experiences for technically minded users. I find it often leads to building tools for less technical users to produce similar outcomes. This allows me to be on the cutting edge of technology, stretch my knowledge base as a designer and a developer and balance the creative and technical sides of myself. I just as happy to discuss and work on APIs as I am designing and building front-end applications as it all has an experience that enables user adoption and productivity.
